### **How It Works**

#### **1. Initial Setup (One-Time)**
1. **Prepare Your Data:**
   - Export your conversations in JSON format and place them in the `chat` folder.
   
2. **Process the Conversations:**
   - Run `main_gpt.py` to convert raw JSON files into structured text files in the `out` folder.
   - Use `export.py` to generate a list of processed conversations for review.

3. **Summarize Conversations:**
   - Run `main.py` to create detailed summaries for each conversation and save them.

4. **Embed and Vectorize Summaries:**
   - Use `faiss_adder_from_files.py` to generate vector embeddings from the summaries and add them to the FAISS database.

#### **2. Adding New Conversations**
- For incremental updates, use `direct_adder.py` to process and add new conversations directly into the database without reprocessing previous data.

#### **3. Search and Retrieve Knowledge**
- Use `faiss_search_ui.py` to perform semantic searches and retrieve relevant knowledge tailored to your queries.

### **Use Cases**
- **Personal Knowledge Base:** Organize and retrieve insights from personal data across platforms.
- **Professional Research:** Aggregate and search through extensive conversation histories for academic or professional projects.
- **Customer Support:** Manage and retrieve historical support chats to improve response accuracy and consistency.
- **Content Creation:** Quickly access and reference past interactions to aid in brainstorming and content generation.
